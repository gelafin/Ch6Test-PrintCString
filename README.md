# PrintCString

Not robust, will clean code later

4) Write a function to print a C-style string character by character. Use a pointer to step through each character of the string and print that character. Stop when you hit a null terminator. Write a main function that tests the function with the string literal “Hello, world!”.

Hint: Use the ++ operator to advance the pointer to the next character.
